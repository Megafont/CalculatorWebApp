        To run the React+NextJS version of the Calculator web app, open the root folder in VS Code and type the
        following into the terminal:
        <p>
            <font face="courier new">
                npm run dev
            </font>
        </p>

        Full setup instructions can be found in <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/installation">this
            course</a>, which is how I got started on this stuff during the P1 Discord bot project.

        As you can see on that page, you can install the required packages using the following command:

        <p>
            <font face="courier new">
                npm install react@latest react-dom@latest next@latest
            </font>
        </p>

        This will install the latest versions of React, React-DOM, and NextJS. Remember, DOM stands for Document Object
        Model.
        These packages were too large to just commit into the GitHub repository, but you need to have them all installed
        in the project folder or the <font face="courier new">npm run dev</font> command won't work.
